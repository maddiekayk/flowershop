    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>01) How do I make a custom bouquet?</h3>
    <p>
      When you come into our store, we have options of choosing different
      flowers and the wrapping materials. The finished custom bouquets range in
      price from $35 to $80.
    </p>
    <h3>
      02) Can I order online and have it shipped or do I have to show up in
      person?
    </h3>
    <p>
      We do take orders over the phone and we have one delivery driver who goes
      around once a day to deliver the bouquets.
    </p>
    <h3>03) Can I bring my own flowers and you will wrap them?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes! We offer a wrapping service for flowers brought in either from nature
      or a different store.
    </p>
    <h3>04) Do you offer vases instead of paper wrapping?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes we do. It will cost extra if it is a vase we have on hand but you can
      also bring in your own vase and we will provide the flowers
    </p>
